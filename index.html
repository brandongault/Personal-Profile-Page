        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Although I tell people I live in Three Rivers, Michigan, I grew up overseas in a few different African countries as well as other continents. Until recently I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life and what career to pursue but that all changed when I found coding and specifically Treehouse.</p>
        <p>I've been teaching myself how to code for about 2 years now using free resources and coding websites but none of those really helped me become the coder I want and intend to become. One day I came across Treehouse and was amazed at how simple and effective it was on getting points across and teaching coding languages in a manner that made it easy to retain. </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>My goals are to become proficient in all three of the main Front End Web Development languages which are HTML, CSS and Javascript. I also want to learn any and all languages that will make me a better Front End Developer, an asset to whichever company I work for and also to the team I work with. The languages I know and am currently learning are</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'd like to work for a company that has an excellent culture and work atmosphere that makes coming into the office one of the most exciting parts of my day. To also have coworkers that are like a second family and an environment that propels me to learn, grow and become the best developer I can be.</p>
